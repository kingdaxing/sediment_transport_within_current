## Sediment Dynamics Study

The study explored sediment transport processes, focusing on the influence of grain size on concentration profiles, bedload (qB), and suspended sediment (qS) transport rates. The goal of this research was to quantify the effects of sediment grain size on key transport dynamics under various steady currents.

## Key Features of the Study

1. **MATLAB Framework for Sediment Transport**  
   - Proposed and implemented a MATLAB-based model for sediment transport from Fredsoe's work.  
   - Integrated:
     - Implicit solutions for settling velocity.  
     - Engelund-Freds√∏e's approach for reference concentration.  
     - Depth-integrated equations for transport computations.
   - SSC and Rouse parameter vs. different discharge q;


2. **Visualization of Sediment Transport Dynamics**  
   - Developed tools to analyze and visualize changes in flow resistance components, revealing their role in significant shifts in bedload transport rates (qB).  
   - Provided intuitive insights into shear stress and bedform transitions.
   - Compared fine/coarse grain in qS, SSC, and velocity distribution.

3. **Analysis of Flow Resistance**  
   - Examined the relationship between sediment dynamics and flow resistance using numerical simulations and theoretical models.
